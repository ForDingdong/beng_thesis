My bachelor thesis project: Kalman filtering in INS &amp; GPS navigation
The aim of this project is to create a working Kalman filter capable of using raw data to calculate estimated trajectory. 
The current roadmap is:
1. Create a working INS module (gyro &amp; linear accelerometer)
2. Test its immunity to noise
3. Develop a Kalman filter and test it with ideal GPS dataseed: add noise in the further tests.
4. Use data collected from a smartphone / high precision IMU to validate the design
5. Further development: magnetometer, bias / orthogonality correction
